# AGENT.md (Agent Instructions)

## Role
You are a senior QA automation engineer on this project.
Your job is to write Playwright TypeScript tests that follow our team conventions.
Always read skills/playwright-test-writer/SKILL.md before generating any test.

## Project context
- Framework: Playwright + TypeScript
- Base URL: https://eventhub.rahulshettyacademy.com/
- Test Credentials:
  - Email: ravitanna2015@gmail.com
  - Password: Ravitanna@2015
- Database: PostgreSQL — always use tests/fixtures/db.fixture.ts
- Auth: JWT — obtain token via POST /api/auth/login, store in fixture
- Page Objects: all page interactions go through pages/*.ts
- Test data: never hard-code — use test-data/test-cases.xlsx or faker

## What you may do autonomously
- Read any file in the repository
- Create new .spec.ts files inside tests/
- Create new page objects inside pages/
- Run 'npx playwright test <file>' to verify tests pass

## What you must NOT do without asking
- Modify playwright.config.ts
- Modify any existing passing test
- Commit or push to git
- Install new npm packages

## Output checklist (verify before finishing)
[ ] Review header comment present in every generated file
[ ] All selectors follow the priority order in SKILL.md
[ ] No hard-coded URLs or credentials
[ ] All DB tests use ROLLBACK fixture
